### Branch Architecture

Workflow

1.⁠ ⁠Fork the repository to your account
2.⁠ ⁠⁠Do all the required changes in your fork
3.⁠ ⁠⁠Once done with the your changes pull the latest changes from our repo again (this is done to pull any parallel changes done in our website after you have forked the repo)
4.⁠ ⁠⁠Check if your changes, so that it doesn’t break the current code
5.⁠ ⁠⁠Give PR(pull request) to dev_main
6.⁠ ⁠⁠Make sure to give proper descriptions in your PR to make it understandable
7.⁠ ⁠⁠If we receive more than 1 PR at the same time, after we merge one of the PRs , the next contributor may be asked to pull the latest changes again and re-check their PR for conflicts.
